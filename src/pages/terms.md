## Introduction

These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of the **Tax ID validation software and related services** provided under the brand **Lookuptax**, owned and operated by **Kadalas Tech LLP** (“Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).

By accessing and using our software, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you may not use our software.

## Consent and Data Processing

By creating an account, subscribing to our services, or using our **Tax ID validation software**, you automatically consent to:

- The collection, processing, and storage of your personal data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Receiving marketing and promotional communications from us, which you may opt out of at any time as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy)
- Receiving essential service communications (e.g., account notifications, billing information, security alerts) that are required for account operation

Your continued use of our software constitutes ongoing consent. For full details on how we process your data, the legal bases for processing, and how to manage your communication preferences, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## Use of Software

Our **Tax ID validation software** is intended for use by individuals and businesses for the purpose of validating Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), VAT numbers, GSTINs, EINs, and other government-issued tax IDs. You may not use our software for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.

You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using our software. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account.

## Fair Use Policy

Our free tier is designed to allow individuals and small teams to evaluate and use our **Tax ID validation software** on a limited basis. To ensure fair access for all users, the following rules apply:

### One Free Account Per Organisation

Each organisation, company, or affiliated group of entities is entitled to **one (1) free account only**. Creating multiple free accounts across individuals within the same organisation to collectively exceed free tier limits — rather than upgrading to a paid plan — is a violation of these terms.

### Prohibited Conduct

The following activities are considered abuse of our free tier and are strictly prohibited:

- Multiple employees, contractors, or representatives of the same organisation registering separate free accounts to avoid purchasing a paid subscription
- Creating accounts using different email addresses, departments, or subsidiaries to circumvent per-account usage limits
- Sharing, rotating, or pooling free account credentials across individuals within an organisation
- Using automated scripts or bots to create multiple free accounts
- Any other activity designed to exploit the free tier beyond its intended purpose for individual evaluation

### Enforcement

Violations of this Fair Use Policy are reviewed and enforced on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to, at our sole discretion and **without prior notice**, take any of the following actions:

- **Suspend or terminate** any accounts found to be in violation of this Fair Use Policy
- **Consolidate** multiple free accounts belonging to the same organisation into a single account
- **Restrict access** to free tier features for organisations that have demonstrated a pattern of abuse
- **Require upgrade** to a paid plan for continued use of our services
- **Block registrations** from specific domains or IP ranges associated with repeated violations

We may determine organisational affiliation by any reasonable means, including but not limited to email domain, IP address, billing information, usage patterns, and publicly available information.

### Good Faith Usage

We encourage organisations with multiple users to subscribe to one of our paid plans, which offer higher limits, additional features, and dedicated support. If you are unsure whether your usage qualifies under our free tier, please contact us at **[contact@lookuptax.com](mailto:contact@lookuptax.com)** before creating additional accounts.
