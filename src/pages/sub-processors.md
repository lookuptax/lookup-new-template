This page provides transparency into the third-party service providers (sub-processors) that Lookuptax uses to deliver its services. These sub-processors may process limited customer or user data on behalf of Lookuptax, strictly for the purposes described below.

Lookuptax engages sub-processors only where necessary to operate, support, and secure the platform. All sub-processors are contractually bound to data protection obligations consistent with applicable data protection laws and our [Data Processing Addendum (DPA)](/dpa).

## What is a sub-processor?

A sub-processor is a third-party service provider that Lookuptax uses to process data in order to provide our services. This may include cloud infrastructure providers, email delivery services, analytics tools, or customer support platforms.

Sub-processors are not permitted to use data for their own independent purposes.
